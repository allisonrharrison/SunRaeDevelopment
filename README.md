### My Personal Portfolio Website


#### About
On February 3rd, 2020, I graduated from my Web Development bootcamp! To kick off my new life journey, I wanted to put all of my work in one central place to show others.

#### Features
This site is built in React, for the lulz. View the packages tab for more.

#### What I Learned
I had no idea how to actually host a website with a custom domain until I figured it out for myself, so that was a fun learning experience. I also learned about Google Analytics and Search Engine Optimization.
